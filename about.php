The theme is a perfect starting point for authors who want to utilize Bootstrap in their own themes.<p></p>The code is modular and extends the Bootstrap framework rather than directly adopt it. This means that further extension and customization is very easy once you're familiar with <b><a href='http://sass-lang.com/'>SASS</a></b> and <b><a href='http://compass-style.org/'>Compass</a></b>.",
